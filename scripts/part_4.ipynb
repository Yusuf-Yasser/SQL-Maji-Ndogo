    "### Overview\n",
    "Welcome to part four of this project which is aimed at enhancing water access in Maji Ndogo. This initiative focuses on leveraging data analysis to identify areas for improvement and strategically allocate resources to optimize water sources across provinces and towns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Goal\n",
    "The primary objective of this project is to enhance water access in Maji Ndogo through targeted interventions and data-driven decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Joining Pieces Together: Finding the Data We Need Across Tables**\n",
    "   - Combine data from various tables to extract essential information.\n",
    "   - Ensure seamless integration of location, water source, and visit data for comprehensive analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **The Last Analysis: Finding the Final Insights from Our Data**\n",
    "   - Conduct a thorough analysis to derive meaningful insights.\n",
    "   - Identify key patterns and relationships within the data to inform decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Summary Report: Sharing Our Knowledge with Decision-Makers**\n",
    "   - Compile a comprehensive report summarizing findings and recommendations.\n",
    "   - Present insights in a clear and actionable format for stakeholders and decision-makers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **A Practical Plan: From Analysis to Action**\n",
    "   - Translate insights into actionable steps for implementation.\n",
    "   - Develop a strategic plan based on data analysis to address water-related challenges effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to transform data into actionable insights, guiding the strategic enhancement of water access in Maji Ndogo for the benefit of the community."

    "## 1. **Joining Pieces Together: Finding the Data We Need Across Tables**\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the data needed across tables, the process involves combining information from different sources to extract essential insights for analysis. This integration is crucial for understanding the relationships between various data points and deriving meaningful conclusions. Here are the key details regarding this point:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Integration Process:**\n",
    "  - Combine data from tables like visits, well_pollution, location, and water_source to create a comprehensive dataset.\n",
    "  - Use SQL JOIN operations, such as LEFT JOIN, to merge data from multiple tables based on specific criteria.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Query Execution:**\n",
    "  - Utilize SQL queries to assemble relevant data into a single table for simplified analysis.\n",
    "  - Ensure that the JOIN operations are correctly structured to include all necessary information from different tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Insight Extraction:**\n",
    "  - Extract specific data points like water source types, location details, and pollution results to identify patterns and relationships.\n",
    "  - The goal is to uncover insights that can guide decision-making and strategic planning for addressing water-related challenges effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "By effectively joining pieces of data together from various tables, this process enables a comprehensive analysis that forms the foundation for deriving actionable insights and making informed decisions to improve water access in the targeted areas."

    "In the situation of corruption involving field workers, President of Maji Ndogo took swift action upon being informed about the issue. She expressed gratitude to the team for uncovering the corruption and emphasized a zero-tolerance policy towards individuals prioritizing personal gain over the community's welfare. The President's commitment to combating corruption and prioritizing data-driven decision-making instilled hope for positive change in Maji Ndogo. The team's efforts to convert data into actionable knowledge, shape raw data into meaningful views for decision-makers, and create job lists for engineers were highlighted as crucial steps towards addressing water-related challenges effectively. The focus shifted towards translating understanding into informed decisions, planning budgets, identifying areas needing immediate attention, and ultimately transforming Maji Ndogo for a brighter future."

    "1. Most water sources are rural in Maji Ndogo.\n",
    "2. 43% of our people are using shared taps. 2000 people often share one tap.\n",
    "3. 31% of our population has water infrastructure in their homes, but within that group,\n",
    "4. 45% face non-functional systems due to issues with pipes, pumps, and reservoirs. Towns like Amina, the rural parts of Amanzi, and a couple\n",
    "of towns across Akatsi and Hawassa have broken infrastructure.\n",
    "5. 18% of our people are using wells of which, but within that, only 28% are clean. These are mostly in Hawassa, Kilimani and Akatsi.\n",
    "6. Our citizens often face long wait times for water, averaging more than 120 minutes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    • Queues are very long on Saturdays.\n",
    "    \n",

    "1. We want to focus our efforts on improving the water sources that affect the most people.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    • Most people will benefit if we improve the shared taps first.\n",
    "2. Wells are a good source of water, but many are contaminated. Fixing this will benefit a lot of people.\n",
    "3. Fixing existing infrastructure will help many people. If they have running water again, they won't have to queue, thereby shorting queue times\n",
    "for others. So we can solve two problems at once.\n",
    "4. Installing taps in homes will stretch our resources too thin, so for now if the queue times are low, we won't improve that source.\n",

    "### **Practical solutions:**\n",
    "1. If communities are using rivers, we will dispatch trucks to those regions to provide water temporarily in the short term, while we send out\n",
    "crews to drill for wells, providing a more permanent solution. Sokoto is the first province we will target.\n",
    "2. If communities are using wells, we will install filters to purify the water. For chemically polluted wells, we can install reverse osmosis (RO)\n",
    "filters, and for wells with biological contamination, we can install UV filters that kill microorganisms - but we should install RO filters too. In\n",
    "the long term, we must figure out why these sources are polluted.\n",
    "3. For shared taps, in the short term, we can send additional water tankers to the busiest taps, on the busiest days. We can use the queue time\n",
    "pivot table we made to send tankers at the busiest times. Meanwhile, we can start the work on installing extra taps where they are needed.\n",
    "According to UN standards, the maximum acceptable wait time for water is 30 minutes. With this in mind, our aim is to install taps to get\n",
    "queue times below 30 min. Towns like Bello, Abidjan and Zuri have a lot of people using shared taps, so we will send out teams to those\n",
    "towns first.\n",
    "4. Shared taps with short queue times (< 30 min) represent a logistical challenge to further reduce waiting times. The most effective solution,\n",
    "installing taps in homes, is resource-intensive and better suited as a long-term goal.\n",
    "5. Addressing broken infrastructure offers a significant impact even with just a single intervention. It is expensive to fix, but so many people can\n",
    "benefit from repairing one facility. For example, fixing a reservoir or pipe that multiple taps are connected to. We identified towns like Amina,\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Resource Allocation:**\n",
