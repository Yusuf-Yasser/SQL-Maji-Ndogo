    "### Overview:\n",
    "Welcome to my personal data project focused on addressing a water crisis in Maji Ndogo. This project involves analyzing a database of 60,000 records collected by a dedicated team to extract insights and solutions for improving water quality and addressing pollution issues in the area.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Goal:\n",
    "The main goal of this project is to leverage data analysis techniques to understand different water sources, assess water quality, identify pollution issues, and ultimately contribute to solving the water crisis in Maji Ndogo.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Get to Know Our Data:\n",
    "- **Exploring the Foundational Tables and Their Structure:**\n",
    "  - Understanding the structure of the database tables.\n",
    "  - Identifying relationships between tables using \"_id\" columns.\n",
    "  - Accessing the data dictionary for detailed documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Dive into Sources:\n",
    "- **Understanding Different Sources with SELECT:**\n",
    "  - Identifying the table containing information on water sources.\n",
    "  - Writing SQL queries to retrieve unique types of water sources.\n",
    "  - Exploring the types of water sources like tap in home, tap in home broken, well, shared tap, and river.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Unpack the Visits:\n",
    "- **Discovering the Visit Patterns:**\n",
    "  - Identifying the table logging visits to water sources.\n",
    "  - Writing SQL queries to retrieve records based on visit patterns, like time spent in queues.\n",
    "  - Analyzing multiple visits to shared taps for queue time variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Water Source Quality:\n",
    "- **Understanding Water Quality:**\n",
    "  - Locating the table containing quality scores assigned by field surveyors.\n",
    "  - Analyzing quality scores ranging from 1 to 10 for different water sources.\n",
    "  - Investigating records with high quality scores for home taps and revisited sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Pollution Issues:\n",
    "- **Correcting Pollution Data with LIKE and String Operations:**\n",
    "  - Identifying the table recording contamination/pollution data for well sources.\n",
    "  - Examining the pollutants, contamination levels, and classifications (Clean, Contaminated: Biological, Contaminated: Chemical).\n",
    "  - Linking pollution data to specific sources in Maji Ndogo for further analysis and action.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to not only explore the database but also develop meaningful insights through data analysis, contributing towards sustainable solutions for the water crisis in Maji Ndogo. Let's dive into this project together and make a positive impact!"

    "## 1. **Get to Know Our Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify Tables:**\n",
    "   - Use the `SHOW TABLES` query to list all tables in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Table Purpose:**\n",
    "   - Understand the role of each table in storing specific types of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Retrieve First Records:**\n",
    "   - Write a `SELECT` statement to retrieve the first five records from each table.\n",
    "   - Examine the columns and their data types in each table to understand the information they contain.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Explore Data Content:**\n",
    "   - Review the retrieved records to grasp the type of data present in each table.\n",
    "   - Note down the information stored in each table to build a comprehensive understanding of the database content.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, we will gain a solid foundation in understanding the data structure and content within the database, setting the stage for further exploration and analysis to extract meaningful insights for addressing the water crisis in Maji Ndogo.\n"

    "      - **Implications:** High risk of contamination with biological and other pollutants, making it the least desirable water source due to health risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. **Well:**\n",
    "      - **Characteristics:** Draws water from underground sources, commonly shared by communities.\n",
    "      - **Implications:** Less likely to be contaminated compared to a river; however, many wells may be unclean due to aging infrastructure and past corruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "   3. **Shared Tap:**\n",
    "      - **Characteristics:** Tap located in a public area shared by communities.\n",
    "      - **Implications:** Serves multiple individuals, providing access to clean water for a significant number of people.\n",
    "\n",
    "   4. **Tap in Home:**\n",
    "      - **Characteristics:** Taps installed inside homes, serving about 6 people on average.\n",
    "      - **Implications:** Provides convenient access to clean water within households, contributing to improved hygiene and quality of life.\n",
    "\n",
    "   5. **Broken Tap in Home:**\n",
    "      - **Characteristics:** Taps installed in homes but not functional due to infrastructure issues.\n",
